# WORKLOG — shared running log

Append-only session log shared across **both** interfaces (Claude Code in VS Code / Cursor, and
Cowork). Newest entry at the top. This is how work done in one place carries over to the other:
whatever I do in a session, I record here before finishing.

**How to use:** at the start of a session, read this + `docs/CONTEXT.md`. At the end, add an entry
below with today's date. Keep entries short (3–8 lines): what changed, why, decisions, what's next.
For durable/architectural facts, also update `docs/CONTEXT.md` (and add an ADR when warranted).

## 2026-07-08 — Cowork
- Set up cross-interface continuity: added root `CLAUDE.md` (auto-loaded by both VS Code and Cowork)
  and this `WORKLOG.md`. Both now point at `docs/CONTEXT.md` as the source of truth.
- Why: owner wants to work in VS Code while staying aligned here. Chat histories don't sync between
  interfaces, but shared files in the repo do — so context lives in files, not the transcript.
- Next: use this log going forward. Continue Phase 2, Slice 1 (Auth) — see `docs/phase-2-plan.md`.
